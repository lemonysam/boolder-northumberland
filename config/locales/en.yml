      history:
        title: The story
        p1: "Climbin is born out of the enthusiasm and generosity of the Boolder team. Their decision to make their Fontainbleau based app available for free and to open their source code for other projects makes this possible."
        p2: 'Whilst on holiday in Fontainbleau Sam and Ian made heavy use of the Boolder app and were really impressed by its flexibilty and ease of use, when they got back Sam was tasked with working out whether we could adapt it to our region.'
        p3: "As the area prepares for the next generation of guidebooks to be written, it's become clear how fragmented our climbing databases have become and how sizable the barrier is to sharing new developments."
        p4: So now, the team are working to build out a database of the best climbing Northeast England has to offer, and to share that database with all of you.
      project:
        title: The Project
        contact: contact
        p1_html: Climbin is a non-profit project, managed by volunteers - we are an extension of the incredible work done by the %{link} team in Fontainebleau.
        p2_html: Our goal is to make discovering bouldering in North East England <strong>easy</strong> and to open up information on our region's climbing to all who want to use it.
        p3_html: The project is still very young, we welcome suggestions and ideas to make this a more useful tool. Feel free to %{link} us!

        title: Thanks
        p1: "Firstly we must extend our thanks to the Boolder team, from which this guide takes many of its features and ideas. They are a tremendous asset to the climbing community and we've been grateful for their support."
        p2: "Everyone who has contributed to UK climbing: the climbers, first ascensionist and all those who have contributed to the discovery, access arrangements, maintenance and cleaning of crags."
        p3: We also extend our thanks to local activists, who have provided a wealth of firsthand data and carried out numerous on-the-ground operations.

        data:
          question: Where does the data come from?
          p1: Photos and geographical data (GPS) were collected by the Climbin team.
          p2_html: The problem names and grades come mainly from local guidebooks and and the miniguides published at %{quiet_county} and %{climbonline}.
        why_free:
          question: Why is the app free?
          p1: Because we want as many people as possible to enjoy it!
          p2: The original Boolder team created their codebase and shared it with the climbing community, we have adapted their work to display UK crags and boulders (and their blessing of course!).
